### Background of Project:

### Installation
-	Pandas for data processing and manipulation.
-	Numpy for basic mathematical operations.
-	Matplotlib for visualization.

### Data
The data was cleaned from an original data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).

    -	Which actor appeared in the most movies?
    -	Which director directed more movies than others?
    -	which production company produced the most movies over the years?
    -	Which year had the best ratings in the movie industry?

    -	What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high profit?
-	Conclusions
